    Attributes
    ----------
    number_of_planes : int
        the number of planes in the constellation
    nodes_per_plane : int
        the number of satellites per plane
    semi_major_axis : float
        semi major axis of the orbits (radius, if orbits circular)
    period : int
        the period of the orbits in seconds
    list_of_satellites: List[Satellites]
        list of all the satellites in the system.
    current_time : int
        keeps track of the current simulation time

    Methods
    -------
    init_satellites()
        Creates kepler ellipse for each satellites and initialize its position at time 0.
    update_position(time=0)
        Updates all satellites to reflect the new time.
    get_all_satellites()
        Returns all the satellites as a list.
        Each satellite contains information like position (x, y, z) and keygroup.
    print_current_position()
        Prints all the position of each satellite.
    print_current_keygroups()
        Print all satellites and their keygroup they currently belong to.
