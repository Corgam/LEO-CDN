2. Run `make setup` command.
3. Run `make satellites` command.
4. Run `make gsts` command.

## Generator.py

Generates certificates and a .yml file for each satellite. Creates a Makefile and then runs docker-compose to start all storage, FReD and HTTP-server nodes automatically. Furthermore, creates all necessary files to run the project.

- Usage: `make generate`

## Ground Stations

Reads the list of groundstations from `temp/filename.txt` (specified in the Config file) and creates a thread for each of them. Groundstation will send n amount of requests (specified in the Config file) in an async fashion to the best satellite (received from the Coordinator).
