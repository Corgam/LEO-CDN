    This class holds all the information about a single satellite.
    Kepler Ellipse, offset are needed for our own simulation. For the integration into Celestial these two are not
    needed hence, we do not need to use e.g. update position in Celestial.


    Attributes
    ----------
    name: str
        Name of the satellite as "satellite{id} of node on plane}"
    kepler_ellipse: KeplerEllipse
        The kepler ellipse of this satellite.
    offset: int
        The offset of this satellite
    current_time: int
        The current time of the simulation in seconds.
    x_position: int
        The unrotated x position of the satellite.
    y_position: int
        The unrotated y position of the satellite.
    z_position: int
        The unrotated z position of the satellite.
    keygroup:
        The current keygroup of the satellite.
    host:
        Host of the satellite.
    port:
        Port of the satellite.
